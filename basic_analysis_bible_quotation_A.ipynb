First, because I'm doing the comparison verse-by-verse against the whole text, and second because the Bible repeats itself.  For example, take a common verse like, \"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying\".  Suppose that it occurs 100 times in the Geneva.  That means for each of those 100, I'm going to check for a match in the full text, and for each I'm going to find 100 matches.  The result is that just that common verse will add 10,000 to the total number of Geneva-to-Geneva matches.  This is, of course, the extreme example, but it is something to keep in mind.\n",
